The idea of writing this article literally fell from the sky, straight into my head, when a sudden hailstorm hit those of us who were watching a cycling race, at a mountain pass called Col de Porte, located in the French Alps. After some lightning and thunder, the storm quickly became very intense, so fast that there was practically no time to seek shelter. For a period of several minutes, hailstones of sizes reaching 2 cm in diameter fell (see figure below), which caused a lot of pain when they hit the body. The worst part was taken by the cyclists who still had to cross the finish line and could not protect their backs at that time.

This hailstorm, which barely comes close to the most extreme cases that usually appear in the news, reminded me how important this type of meteorological phenomenon is, especially because of the damage it can cause to people and infrastructure.

When we think about hailstones, key questions often come to mind associated with how, when and where they are originated, how big these ice balls can be and how much damage they can cause. Some other less frequent questions are related to what are the methods to detect hail, how can we predict in advance the occurrence of hailstorms and finally what are the main challenges in understanding this phenomenon, especially in a climate change scenario. I will now address these questions in simple words, based on the latest international scientific literature.

## What are the impacts of hailstorms?

The largest historical hail records are in Europe and the United States. With sizes that have exceeded 150 mm in Germany, France and Italy; while in the United States there are data on hail up to 200 mm in diameter. I would not want to be around when one of those falls.

Agriculture is strongly affected when intense hail events occur. Precipitations of small hailstones (~6 mm) are sufficient for a complete loss of production of some types of crops. Larger hailstones (~25 mm) can cause damage to cars and buildings. The costs in damages due to hailstorms amount to billions of dollars annually in the most affected countries.

But without a doubt the worst possible impact is the loss of human life. Around the world, there are numerous cases in which intense hailstorms have ended in fatal consequences. One emblematic case occurred in La Paz, Bolivia, during a very intense hailstorm in 2002, lasting just over an hour, where the combination of hail, rain and ground conditions caused a landslide that cost the lives of more than 60 people.


## What exactly are hailstones, how do they form and what environmental conditions do they need?

According to the World Meteorological Organization, a hail is basically a piece of ice with a diameter greater than 5 mm that falls from a convective cloud of great vertical development (Cumulonimbus).

*Fig.3 - Cloud types.*

In order to form hail, several elements and conditions need to be present in the same period of time and space. First of all, there must be particles less than 5 mm in diameter called hail embryos (or seeds), which can be ice crystals that have grown by riming, that is, crystals that have increased in size thanks to thousands of small water droplets that have frozen around the crystal. This type of embryo is regularly called graupel in scientific literature and in the media. In the following figure, two ice crystals can be seen with very low (A) and high (B) levels of riming. Hail embryos can also be frozen water droplets and less frequently other particles of animal or vegetable origin.

A second element for the formation of hail is the presence of water vapor that gives life to the whole system, it is responsible for the formation of the cumulonimbus, the hail embryos and a third very important ingredient, small drops of supercooled liquid water, which are responsible for feeding the embryos to grow healthy and strong, managing to fall to earth without melting in the attempt. These tiny droplets are formed when strong upward air currents (updraft, typical in convective clouds due to their instability) displace water vapor to the upper part of the cloud, where the temperature is low enough to condense the vapor into liquid droplets. In the absence of solid particles such as pollen, salt, dust or other aerosols, called ice nucleus, these water droplets remain liquid despite temperatures below freezing point (0°C), hence the name "supercooled". As you might imagine, staying liquid at such low temperatures is not a very stable situation, so any disturbance can change that state.

We already have all the ingredients on the table. Remember the updrafts I mentioned earlier? They are coming back on the scene, now moving the hail embryos to the higher parts of the cloud. When an embryo collides with the supercooled water droplets, they stick together and freeze quickly, increasing the size of the now newborn hail significantly. Hail trajectories tend to be cyclical, although with only one main long ascent. The longer the hail spends collecting water droplets, the larger it will grow, so the intensity of the updrafts, the lifetime and the vertical extension of the cloud will play a very important role in the maximum size a hail can reach, as well as the availability of supercooled water droplets (the food). To a lesser extent, hailstones can grow by vapor deposition, which means that the water vapor present in the cloud passes directly to a solid state around the hail, while another equally rare form is the aggregation of two or more hailstones. At some point, the lifting produced by the updrafts will not be able to keep the hail in the cloud, due to its great weight, so it will fall irremediably to the ground.

The growth process of hail can be classified into two types: wet growth and dry growth. The first case occurs when the temperature where the droplets are found is not low enough for them to solidify immediately on collision with the hail, forming a layer of water around the hail, until at a high altitude (at a very low temperature) the water layer solidifies with a transparent appearance. This case can be clearly seen in the first figure in this post, where I show a hail in my hand. The hail embryo can be seen in the center and a transparent layer of ice on the outside.

Dry growth occurs when supercooled droplets freeze very quickly when they collide with the embryos, leaving air bubbles between the droplets, making the hail layers rather opaque. The different types of growth have important implications for the energy balance of the atmosphere and also strongly affect the way weather radar waves interact with hail when detecting and measuring it.

I mentioned above the "instability" of convective clouds, by this I meant specifically thermal or hydrostatic instability. In order to have vertical movement of air masses, there must be a strong gradient or difference between the temperature of the ground surface and the top of the cloud. If the humid air near the ground is warm, it will tend to rise because it is less dense than the cold air above it, forming the upward air currents. The changes in wind speed and/or direction as the altitude increases (called vertical wind shear) help to form an outflow area for the air currents after they have cooled down inside the cloud, preventing the inflow warm upward currents from cooling down, which ensures a longer storm (see animation below).

Solar radiation and advection (horizontal transport) of warm air contribute to the heating of the air near the surface. For this reason, convective storms and especially hail storms are more frequent in the warm months and less frequent in cold periods and regions. It is important to note that extremely high temperatures near the ground surface can also play against the production of hail, if it melts before it reaches the ground. Additionally, cooling at the top of the cloud also favors instability.

In several regions of the world, frontal systems play an important role in the formation of highly developed vertical convective storms, including hail storms, because they favor the mechanism of raising the masses of warm air so necessary for particle collisions. Similarly, the mountainous topography also influences the change in direction of horizontal and vertical air currents, favoring the formation of hail storms.

Finally, the storms called supercells are immense convective storms in rotation, generally associated with intense winds, the formation of tornadoes and a high production of hail due to their great vertical development and long duration, up to several hours. This type of storm concentrates all the ingredients to form large hailstones.

To get an idea of how hail storms are distributed around the world, the figure below shows a map of the probability of annual occurrence of hail based on a model that uses the environmental variables that best represent the frequency of hail, such as thermal instability, the height of the isotherm 0°C (where the phase change from solid to liquid occurs), vertical wind speed, among other variables.

## How to detect and measure hail?

In meteorology and sciences in general, the measurement and recording of variables associated with natural phenomena is fundamental to understand their processes, develop models and later evaluate them. When talking about precipitation in general, the frequency of occurrence is a very important variable to study. When it comes to hail, the size of the ice balls is one of the key variables to determine their impacts.

When a hailstorm occurs, it is restricted to a small area, so without a proper observation system it is very difficult to capture its information properly. A major problem is that there are very few widespread and standardized hail storm monitoring networks. The most frequent information is local observations carried out by people. These observations cannot always be rigorous or regular, they can be subject to confusion or inaccuracies, such as confusing graupel or frozen raindrops with hail, but these observations combined with other sources of information can be really valuable to analyze the occurrence of extreme hail.

There are few weather stations that have instruments specially equipped to measure the size and mass of hailstones, such as the Hailpad, which consists of a plastic foam, covered by aluminum or other material, that is placed firmly on the ground to receive the impacts of hailstones, which leave marks that allow to analyze the distribution of sizes. Again, although this information is very valuable, the scarcity of this type of instruments makes it very difficult to characterize the spatial variability at the local scale of hail occurrence.

Finally, weather radars represent a great tool for monitoring this type of phenomena, because they can cover a large area, with high spatial and temporal resolution on a continuous basis. Radars emit an electromagnetic signal that is scattered by particles in the atmosphere, then part of that scattered signal is captured and returned by the radar antenna. This information is processed to know the position in space of the particles, their velocity in the direction of the antenna (using the Doppler effect) and the radar reflectivity (related to the amount of signal returned from the particle). Since hail is much larger than snowflakes and rain, the reflectivity values are much higher and thresholds are used to detect it. It is important to note that remote sensing instruments have a high uncertainty in the estimation of hail size and many times it is not possible to obtain that information. The combination of these techniques with meteorological data or satellite information is very useful to understand the response of hydrometeors (generic name of the different forms that water takes in the atmosphere as rain, clouds or hail, etc.) to electromagnetic waves.

## How to predict in advance the occurrence of hailstorms?

Predicting in advance the occurrence of hail is very important to make timely decisions and avoid severe damage. It is not difficult to know in a general way in which regions hail might fall, because hail is associated with large convective storms. However, given the dynamic nature of this phenomenon and the numerous variables involved in the process of origin, growth and trajectory, it is very difficult to determine exactly where they will touch the ground. Predicting the size of hail is even more difficult and is often underestimated, especially in events with large hail.

The models use information from environmental variables as a reference to estimate the probable maximum size of hail based on terrain elevation, isotherm elevation 0°C, available convective potential energy (CAPE index) measuring thermal instability, among other key variables.

## Climate change and hail challenges

According to various projections, it is expected that there will be an increase in favorable conditions for the development of convective storms, increasing the frequency, intensity and duration in different regions of the world, due to a rise in temperatures, which leads to an increase in the energy available in the atmosphere to generate upward currents of air. However, it is not entirely clear whether these changes will also apply to hail production.

Authors suggest that in some regions of the United States (central and northern plains), for example, the frequency and size of hail will rise, increasing its severity. But the models are very sensitive to the way they are configured and it is very difficult to know how exactly the characteristics of a storm translate into the production of hail, in terms of frequency and size. Just because certain environmental conditions indicate that a phenomenon is favorable, it does not necessarily mean that this phenomenon will occur.

As I mentioned in the section related to hail detection and measurement, there are still many limitations to correctly understand this complex meteorological phenomenon, because we do not have sufficiently dense or properly equipped monitoring networks. These limitations lead to uncertainty that is also transmitted to future projections.

What is clear is the relevance of hail in society and how important it is to understand its current and future situation in greater detail, in order to be prepared and know how to adapt in the best way to possible changes in the coming decades. For this reason, it is fundamental to increase research efforts, improving hail monitoring and modelling methods, among other extreme phenomena that affect us.

If you have made it this far, you may have the interest and motivation to contribute to the future of hail research by adding a new piece to this interesting and still mysterious puzzle.
