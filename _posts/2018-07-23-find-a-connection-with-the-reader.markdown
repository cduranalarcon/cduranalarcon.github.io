The idea of writing this article literally fell from the sky, straight into my head, when a sudden hailstorm hit those of us who were watching a cycling race, at a mountain pass called Col de Porte, located in the French Alps. After some lightning and thunder, the storm quickly became very intense, so fast that there was practically no time to seek shelter. For a period of several minutes, hailstones of sizes reaching 2 cm in diameter fell (see figure below), which caused a lot of pain when they hit the body. The worst part was taken by the cyclists who still had to cross the finish line and could not protect their backs at that time.

This hailstorm, which barely comes close to the most extreme cases that usually appear in the news, reminded me how important this type of meteorological phenomenon is, especially because of the damage it can cause to people and infrastructure.

When we think about hailstones, key questions often come to mind associated with how, when and where they are originated, how big these ice balls can be and how much damage they can cause. Some other less frequent questions are related to what are the methods to detect hail, how can we predict in advance the occurrence of hailstorms and finally what are the main challenges in understanding this phenomenon, especially in a climate change scenario. I will now address these questions in simple words, based on the latest international scientific literature.

### What are the impacts of hailstorms?

The largest historical hail records are in Europe and the United States. With sizes that have exceeded 150 mm in Germany, France and Italy; while in the United States there are data on hail up to 200 mm in diameter. I would not want to be around when one of those falls.

Agriculture is strongly affected when intense hail events occur. Precipitations of small hailstones (~6 mm) are sufficient for a complete loss of production of some types of crops. Larger hailstones (~25 mm) can cause damage to cars and buildings. The costs in damages due to hailstorms amount to billions of dollars annually in the most affected countries.

But without a doubt the worst possible impact is the loss of human life. Around the world, there are numerous cases in which intense hailstorms have ended in fatal consequences. One emblematic case occurred in La Paz, Bolivia, during a very intense hailstorm in 2002, lasting just over an hour, where the combination of hail, rain and ground conditions caused a landslide that cost the lives of more than 60 people.







### Why not indeed!

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender?! You stole the atom. You don't know how to do any of those.

* Shinier than yours, meatbag.
* This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.
* Ooh, name it after me!

Say what? Throw her in the brig. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Ow, my spirit! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I'm Santa Claus! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Noooooo! I can explain. It's very valuable.

I'm Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.

It doesn't look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You're going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

Bender, we're trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
