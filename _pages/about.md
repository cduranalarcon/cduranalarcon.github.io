Hello and welcome to ICED-A3! My name is Claudio Durán-Alarcón, a passionate about science and technology, as well as a nature lover, born in Santiago de Chile. For many years I was a scout of the San Luis Beltrán Group and also belonged to the Wechupún mountaineering group. In my first years of university I studied Renewable Resources Engineering at the Universidad de Chile, where my interest in Earth Sciences, glaciology and remote sensing started. Together with a team of motivated colleagues we created a new laboratory at the Universidad de Chile called "Laboratory for the Analysis of the Biosphere" (LAB), dedicated to the study of Earth using quantitative remote sensing. In this laboratory I investigated the retreat of tropical glaciers and the Arctic Amplification. Later, I continued my studies in the Master of Earth Sciences specialized in climate, environment and water at the Université Joseph Fourier (Grenoble, France), with a strong emphasis on glaciology and atmospheric sciences. All the way through, it took me to continue a PhD in Earth Sciences at the "Institut des Geosciences de l'Environnement" (IGE) based at the Université Grenoble Alpes, studying solid precipitation using ground-based radars and an atmospheric lidar, as well as in-situ measurements in Antarctica and the Alps, places where I had the opportunity to go, deploy the instruments and collect data. I hope that ICED-A3 will be a good tool to share with you my current and future experiences in the Polar and Alpine scientific field.

## Research interests
 

My main research interests are listed below:

    - Polar Meteorology and Climate: Observations and modeling in polar regions.
    - Trends and extreme patterns: Temperatures, rainfall/snowfall, glacier retreat.
    - Radar remote sensing: Quantitative Estimation of Precipitation, analysis of vertical structure of the troposphere.
    -Surface mass/energy balance: In polar and mountain regions.
    -Atmospheric rivers: Transport of moisture from the tropics towards polar and mid-latitudes regions.
